					"Politics in the Nine Hells are anything but predictable. Alliances form all the time, but most wind up unraveling due to treachery. Nevertheless, for all their backbiting and betrayal, devils do occasionally display loyalty, offering unwavering service to their masters. One such example is Hutijin, a duke of Cania and loyal servant of Mephistopheles.",
					"Across the Hells, Hutijin's name fills lesser devils with fear and loathing, for this duke commands two companies of {@creature pit fiend|MM|pit fiends}. With such soldiers under his command, Hutijin can easily crush any rival who gets in his way while also defending Mephistopheles against armies seeking to contest his dominion. Hutijin has amassed enough power to challenge the lord of Cania, but he has never wavered in his support for his master—suggesting, perhaps, that Mephistopheles has some hold over him.",
					"Outside the Nine Hells, Hutijin is a relatively obscure figure, known only to the most learned infernal scholars. He has no cults of his own, and his servants are few in number. The reason is simple: Hutijin hates mortals. When summoned from the Hells, he repays the instigator with a long and agonizing death.",
					"Mephistopheles forbids Hutijin from making too many forays into the Material Plane, since the duke's absence leaves him vulnerable to his rivals. Other archdevils know how much Hutijin despises mortals and have secretly disseminated the means to call him from the Nine Hells in the hope of distracting the archdevil long enough for them to assail Mephistopheles. Hutijin sends devils into the Material Plane to eradicate mention of his name and destroy those who have learned of him, but the summonings still occur. When called from his post, he negotiates as quickly as he can, usually closing a deal with little cost to the summoner. However, once the deal has been fulfilled, Hutijin repays the interruption with death."
